Alfred Reference Framework
==========================

Framework for Alfred which makes it simple to create workflows to search and look up user-defined static information.

Speeds up the process of creating a Alfred Workflow that assists with small data retrieval.

Generalization of the <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-tea-master">Alfred Tea Master Workflow</a>. All that is required is modification of <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-reference-framework/blob/master/data.alfredreference">data.arf</a>, which is a plain text file (arf = alfred reference framework).

Sample data is a reference of the planets in the solar system.

Actively under development, currently functional.

###Future Additions
<ul>
<li> Library to dynamically create .arf file using Bash (ARF+)
<li> LaTeX Guide
<li> Web form that allows for easy creation of "data.arf" files.
<li> Mod to a Flashcard Framework
</ul>
