Alfred Reference Framework
==========================

Framework for Alfred which makes it simple to create workflows to search and look up user-defined information.

Generalization of the <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-tea-master">Alfred Tea Master Workflow</a>. All that is required is modification of data.alfredreference, which is a plain text file.

Placeholder data is a reference of the planets in the solar system.

Still under development.
