Alfred Reference Framework
==========================

Framework for Alfred written in Bash which makes it easy to create workflows to search and look up information without leaving the Alfred interface. This gets around the issue caused by the fact that <a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/5-generating-feedback-in-workflows/">"Script Filters are the only way to pass feedback to Alfred"</a>. 

## How it works:

<ol>

<li> As with all Alfred Workflows, the user begins by typing in workflow's keyword, in this case, "arf"<br>
<img src="http://www.danieljchen.com/images/project/arf/keyword.png">

<li>The user then types in his/her query, and results are displayed. Again, part of the standard Alfred Workflow.<br>
<img src="http://www.danieljchen.com/images/project/arf/search.png"><br>

Normally at this point, the user will select a result and something <b>outside of Alfred</b> will occur, whether that's bring up a webpage, open/do something in a third-party application, etc. The limitations of the Alfred interface mean that once results for a query are displayed, selection of the results means Alfred is done.<p>

<li>With the Alfred Reference Framework, however, this is not the case. Selection of one of the search results generates a special query which then displays results <b>without having to leave Alfred.</b><br>

Another example of a static ARF workflow is the <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-tea-master">Alfred Tea Master Workflow</a>, which is the code generalized to make ARF. 

## Installation


## Creating an ARF workflow

There are two ways to create an ARF workflow: static and dynamic. 

Static is best if you have data which does not change. This mode requires no coding and is just a matter of populating a !-delimited text file. The user's input searches over the names of the data. 

Dynamic is best if you have data that changes over time (for example, tweets containing a certain hashtag), from computer to computer, or any other variable. It requires using the ARF+ library and you have to create your own method for determining what results to display (as opposed to the simple name-search offered in static mode).

### Static Mode
To create an ARF workflow in static mode, all that is required is modification of <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-reference-framework/blob/master/arf/data/static.arf">static.arf</a>, which is a '!' delimited plain text file in the "data" folder containing the data searched and displayed. 

Here's an example of what the data looks like for the results shown in the <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-reference-framework#how-it-works">example in this README</a>:

> Sun!1.9891 Ã— 10^30 kilograms!N/A						
> Mercury!0.330 x 10^24 kilograms!1    
> Venus!4.87 x 10^24!2   
> Earth!5.97 x 10^24 kilograms!3 	  
> ...

That is the input for the data. Each line corresponds to one potential result, you can have them as anything you'd like, with any number of fields (determined by "!" separation), although there are some characters that you should avoid which are documented in the comments of <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-reference-framework/blob/master/arf/data/static.arf">static.arf</a>. ARF will automatically search over the first field for you (in this case Sun, Mercury, Venus...) to give the results back to the user. When a result is selected, the rest of the information in the line of that result will be displayed. See the example <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-reference-framework#how-it-works">above</a> for clarification.

There are five other things you need to define as well, which are and must be the first five lines of the file. These are the "preference lines". 
> Planet Name!Mass!Order From Sun    		  
> arf/img/f1/default.png!arf/img/f2/default.png!arf/img/f3/default.png  
> no!no!no  
> no!no!no  
> !!! 

Each line has and must have the same number of "!" as the data. Each field in the preferences correspond to the same field in the data. So, for example, the preferences "Planet Name," "arf/img/f1/default.png," "no," "no," and "" all apply to Sun. 

If you are just looking to make a very basic workflow to look up data, you probably only need to modify the first two lines, and the other three should remain the same. Here's what the preference lines are:
<ol>
<li> The first line contains the field names which correspond to the data types. This is displayed when a result is selected in the subtext.
<li> The second line defines the default image displayed for that result. An easy starting point is "icon.png" if you don't have images yet.
<li> The third line defines the "valid" attribute. This determines whether the "autocomplete" or "argument" attribute is used when the result is selected.
<li> The fourth line defines the "autocomplete" attribute, only used when valid is no. When the result is selected, the autocomplete attribute replaces the user query. In ARF, an autocomplete attribute of "no" simply does nothing when the result is selected.
<li> The fifth line defines the "argument" attribute, only used when valid is yes. This passes a query to action.sh, which requires some coding. You could use this to open a webpage, run a script, or do a variety of other things.
</ol>

<a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/5-generating-feedback-in-workflows/">Official documentation on the attributes defined in the last three lines.</a>

That's pretty much all you need. For more explanation on how to make a ARF workflow in static mode, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-reference-framework/blob/master/arf/data/static.arf">static.arf</a>, which is commented with instructions. 

Make sure that you remove all non-data and non-preference lines (including empty lines and comment lines) before production, as it slows down your search.

### Dynamic Mode
To create a dynamic ARF workflow, you have to modify the dynamic.sh file using the arf+ library.


### Images
For adding default images for results

### Interactivity



## Development

Actively under development, currently functional on static mode. v1.0 will be when arf+ is finished. ARF+ is a library that will allow for the dynamic generation of results that can be searched and displayed. This will allow dynamic information to be retrieved from the web and other sources. Please feel free to contribute.

###Future Additions / Potential Pull Requests
<ul>
<li> Ability to specify searchable fields 
<li> Display either recent searches (by saving user input when they select a result) or default searches (similar to in <a href="https://github.com/cheniel/alfred-tea-master">Alfred Tea Master Workflow</a>) before user inputs a query
<li> Ability to add interactively add data from Alfred interface (static only)
<li> Web form that allows for easy creation of "data.arf" files for static usage.
</ul>

Let me know if you use it to make a workflow and I'll put it here.
